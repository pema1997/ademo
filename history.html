    <h1 style="text-align: center;">What is wrong with the system?
    </h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Should we blame our economic system? 
        or is it just the human greed to<br> take advantage of the inferior? Why are labours still underpaid in 21st century?
        <br>Especially, what does it takes for a loyal worker to be true loyal to their employer? <br>Is the labour exploitation justifiable? </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Where did it start?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> The unethical treatment of labor dates back to 1500s during the medieval <br>period when poor peasants were forced to work under their employers, also known <br>as lord back in the medieval age,the government also made sure that the peasants gets no say in their work <br> or rebel against their treatment by their employers. "Masters <br>and Servents act" also required to labors to work under their employers for a long period of time, surviving on a very low pay. Gradually, <br>Capitalism took in chanrge of the economic system resuliting in large numbers of unethically treated workers.<br> This process of industrilization exploited workers in a way that would be intolerable today. The greedy employers hired cheap labors <br> such as children and women. </p>
    
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Emergence of labor union</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> If it wasn't for the people who fought for fair wage, ethical treatment of labors then we would have been sitll living under the greed of Capitalist's employers. <br>The emergence of labor union dates back to 18th century during the industrial revolution.The unions were initiated by artisans late in the colonial period. <br>The first strike against the reduced wage took place in New York in 1768 by Journeyman Tailors.These stirkes eventually led to the formation of <br> "Federal Society of Journeymen Cordwainers in 1794. <br>This marks as the beginning of trade union among American workers. Craft unions demaded for fair-wage and rebeled against cheap labors and labors exploitation. Craftmen formed unions such as "The Mechanics' Union of Trade Assiosiation" in 1827 and "International Typographical union in 1852." <br>National and state union began to work together from all across The United States and Canada. However, these unions were focused and led by skilled workers and the workers in lower sector played little role during the period. </p>
